Description: Its official site of LaxmiAgencies to feature thier projects.

The site is developed with pure HTML, css and JS. The agencies don't want to spent money on hosting. So, I had to come up with JSON object acting as DB and serve the locations of the images.

I have used a lot Py scripts to automate much of the process - resize images, bulid the navbar, place the image in place.

The files are distorted here.
